### Reminders on how to render website

-   Open project locally in R studio and edit the quarto files accordingly
-   Then navigate to the build tab in the bottom left pane and press `Render Website`
-   This will produce the html files for GitHub to render the website
-   Finally commit and push changes to my GitHub and the deployment should occur automatically
