You can find out more about this work from the University of Exeter here and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust here.\nI am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at the University of Exeter. I am investigating the movement and wider dispersal of Common Pheasants Phasianus colchicus from both a game management perspective and to limit dispersal into protected areas."
