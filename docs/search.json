We hope to use breeding abundance data from a nationwide survey to model the field-level and wider landscape-level factors that drive breeding abundance. From this model we will predict the impact of proposed future conservation scenarios on breeding wader populations. These scenarios will focus on three key regions with nationally important populations of lowland breeding waders (Somerset Levels, Norfolk Broads and Greater Thames)"

I reviewed and assessed available literature that contained data that could be used to derive estimates of the avoidance rate parameter. Avoidance rates were calculated using this data with two variants of the Band (2012) collision risk model and their stochastic implementations. Estimates were compared to previous industry standards in (Cook 2021) and we found increases in the avoidance rates for the following species groupings: all gulls, large gulls, and all gulls & terns.\nA link to the report and supporting materials can be found here.

I investigated different factors that could be contributing to population decline. This included lead poisoning and shooting disturbance on Islay, Scotland from shooting of the Barnacle Goose population on the island. I also investigated how changes to the climate in the Western Greenland breeding grounds could be causing low breeding success across the population. To fully investigate this we deployed biologging devices across the wintering range and remotely examined breeding using remote sensing data and biologging data to remotely classify breeding events.\n\n\n\nGreenland White-fronted Goose"
