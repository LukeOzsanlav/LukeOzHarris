# Hi, I'm Luke

I am an ecologist that is broadly interested in ornithology, animal movement and applied ecological research.

Currently I am a conservation scientist at the RSPB. I am investigating the drivers of lowland breeding wader populations in order to predict which future conservation scenarios would maximise the benefits to breeding populations.

I enjoy looking for birds in my local area and further afield, you can see my latest pictures and checklists on my [eBird profile](https://ebird.org/profile/MTEyNDg3Ng/world)
