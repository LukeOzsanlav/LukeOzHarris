# Hi, I'm Luke

I am an ecologist that is broadly interested in ornithology, animal movement and applied ecological research.

Currently I work as a Flyways Science Office for BirdLife International. The global flyways programme seeks to conserve migratory birds and the ecological networks they depend upon. This includes priority areas such as addressing illegal and unsustainable taking and trade of birds, conservation of coastal and inland waterbirds, conservation of migrant landbirds, and ensuring ecological networks of sites. 

I enjoy looking for birds in my local area and further afield. You can see my latest pictures and checklists on my [eBird profile](https://ebird.org/profile/MTEyNDg3Ng/world)
