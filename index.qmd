## Hi, I'm Luke

I am an ecologist that is broadly interested in ornithology, animal movement and applied ecological research.

Currently I am a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Exeter investigating the movement of released gamebirds in the UK

I enjoy looking for birds in my local area and further afield, you can see my latest pictures and species I've seen on my [eBird profile](https://ebird.org/profile/MTEyNDg3Ng/world)
